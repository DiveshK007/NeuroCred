# QIE Hackathon Submission Form Content

Ready-to-use content for the hackathon submission form.

## Project Title

```
NeuroCred – AI Credit Passport on QIE
```

## Tagline

```
AI-powered soulbound credit identity for safer lending on QIE.
```

## Description (2-3 sentences)

```
NeuroCred solves the critical problem of blind lending in DeFi by providing a portable, on-chain credit identity system for QIE blockchain. Our AI-powered scoring engine analyzes wallet history, transaction patterns, and portfolio composition to generate credit scores (0-1000) stored as soulbound NFTs. Any DeFi protocol on QIE can query these scores with a single contract call to make informed lending decisions, enabling safer under-collateralized loans and dynamic interest rates.

## Tech Stack

```
Solidity, Hardhat, TypeScript, Next.js, React, FastAPI, Python, Web3.py, Ethers.js, QIE Testnet, QIE Oracles, QIEDex, OpenZeppelin Contracts
```
