# Demo Video Script

## Duration: 3-5 minutes

### 1. Hook (10-15 seconds)

"On most blockchains, lending is blind. There's no portable on-chain credit identity. NeuroCred fixes that for QIE."

### 2. Problem Statement (30 seconds)

"Today's DeFi lending protocols face a major challenge:
- Most loans are over-collateralized, making them capital inefficient
- There's no way to assess borrower risk on-chain
- Each protocol has to build its own risk assessment from scratch
- New chains like QIE need better tools for safe DeFi adoption"

### 3. Solution Overview (45 seconds)

"NeuroCred solves this with an AI-powered credit passport:
- Wallets get a reusable credit score from 0 to 1000
- The score is stored as a soulbound NFT on QIE
- Any DeFi app can query the score with a single contract call
- Scores are calculated using AI analysis of on-chain activity"

### 4. Live Demo (2-3 minutes)

**Step 1: Connect Wallet**
- "Let me connect my QIE wallet"
- Show wallet connection
- Display address and balance

**Step 2: Generate Score**
- "Now I'll generate my credit passport"
- Click "Generate My Credit Passport"
- Show loading state
- Explain: "Our AI is analyzing my wallet history, transaction patterns, and portfolio composition"

**Step 3: View Results**
- Show score gauge (e.g., 750/1000)
- Show risk band (Low/Medium/High)
- Read explanation: "Low risk: High transaction activity, good volume, stable portfolio"

**Step 4: On-Chain Verification**
- "The score is now stored on-chain as a soulbound NFT"
- Show transaction hash
- Click to view on QIE Explorer
- "Notice this is a soulbound NFT - it can't be transferred, ensuring score integrity"

**Step 5: Integration Demo**
- Switch to dev/integration page
- "Any DeFi protocol can integrate NeuroCred in just a few lines"
- Show code snippet
- "They can adjust loan-to-value ratios, interest rates, or collateral requirements based on the credit score"

### 5. Technical Deep Dive (30-45 seconds)

"Under the hood:
- Smart contracts deployed on QIE Testnet
- FastAPI backend with AI scoring algorithm
- Feature extraction from wallet history
- Integration with QIE Oracles for price data
- QIEDex integration for token creation"

### 6. Vision (20-30 seconds)

"NeuroCred's vision:
- Become the default risk layer for all QIE DeFi protocols
- Enable under-collateralized lending
- Expand to real-world credit and payroll
- Open SDK for easy integration"
