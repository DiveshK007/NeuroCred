# Demo Video Script

## Duration: 3-5 minutes

**Total Target Time:** 4 minutes (240 seconds)

### 1. Hook (10-15 seconds) ⏱️

**Script:**
"On most blockchains, lending is blind. There's no portable on-chain credit identity. NeuroCred fixes that for QIE."

**Visual:**
- Show NeuroCred logo/title
- Quick text overlay: "AI Credit Passport on QIE"

**Timing:** 10-15 seconds

---

### 2. Problem Statement (30 seconds) ⏱️

**Script:**
"Today's DeFi lending protocols face a major challenge:
- Most loans are over-collateralized, making them capital inefficient
- There's no way to assess borrower risk on-chain
- Each protocol has to build its own risk assessment from scratch
- New chains like QIE need better tools for safe DeFi adoption"

**Visual:**
- Show problem statement slides or text
- Highlight pain points

**Timing:** 30 seconds

---

### 3. Solution Overview (30-45 seconds) ⏱️

**Script:**
"NeuroCred solves this with an AI-powered credit passport:
- Wallets get a reusable credit score from 0 to 1000
- The score is stored as a soulbound NFT on QIE
- Any DeFi app can query the score with a single contract call
- Scores are calculated using AI analysis of on-chain activity"

**Visual:**
- Show solution diagram
- Highlight: AI → Score → NFT → DeFi Integration

**Timing:** 30-45 seconds

---

### 4. Architecture (30 seconds) ⏱️

**Script:**
"Here's how NeuroCred works:
- Frontend connects wallets and displays scores
- Backend runs our AI scoring algorithm
- Smart contracts on QIE store scores as soulbound NFTs
- QIE Oracles provide price data for risk assessment"

**Visual:**
- Show architecture diagram:
  ```
  Frontend (Next.js) → Backend (FastAPI) → QIE Blockchain (Contracts)
         ↓                    ↓                      ↓
    Wallet Connect      AI Scoring          Soulbound NFT
  ```
- Or use a simple diagram slide

**Timing:** 30 seconds
